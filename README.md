# Frontend Assessment for Fiable

1. Overview
The goal is to create a React application that includes a component to visualize the placement of an object on a 5x5 grid (table). The position and direction of the object are determined by an input string with the format "x,y direction" (e.g., "1,1 NORTH"). The project will use Material UI for the user interface components and Storybook to document and demonstrate the functionality of the component.

2. Technologies
React: JavaScript framework for building the user interface.

Material UI: React component library for implementing the UI with pre-built components and customizable theming.

Storybook: Tool to document and develop components in isolation.

This project is developed using Vite and React
